# rv32simOS
> **rv32simOS** is an OS kernel running on a custom RISC-V architectural simulator.

## Overview
**rv32simOS** is an OS kernel that runs on a custom 32-bit RISC-V architectural simulator using High-Level Emulation (HLE) written in C++. It features virtual memory with demand paging and swapping, preemptive multi-thread scheduling, synchronization primitives, a virtual file system, and a custom syscall ABI. It serves an educational purpose by bridging the gap between hardware emulation and OS theory.

## Architecture
The system operates on a Sequential execution model with Interrupt Polling. This ensures deterministic behavior and allows for precise debugging of race conditions and scheduling logic.
- **User Space**: Runs unmodified RISC-V ELF binaries. Instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed by the emulated CPU.
- **Kernel Space (Host)**: The OS logic (Scheduler, VMM, VFS, Syscalls) runs as native C++ code.
- **Hardware Interface**: Interrupts are simulated by checking a Hardware Timer flag at the instruction boundary, providing implicit atomicity for kernel operations.


## Features
- **The Core(CPU)**
  - **RV32IM Architecture**: Implements the base RISC-V 32-bit Integer instruction set with Multiplication and Division extension.
  - **Cost Modeling**: Every instruction and system event (trap, context switch, memory alloc, disk I/O) is charged a specific "Time Cost" to simulate hardware latency.
- **Multitasking**
  - **Multi-Threading**: Native support for kernel-managed threads. Processes can spawn multiple threads that share the same page table.
  - **Synchronization**: Provides syncrhonization mechanism including Lock, Semaphore, Condition Variable, and Barrier.
  - **Scheduler**: Implements Round-Robin scheduling with a configurable time quantum. Context switches save and restore full hardware context (registers, PC).
- **Memory Management**
  - **Virtual Memory**: Per-process isolation using page tables.
  - **Lazy Loading**: Code and data segments are demand-paged directly from the ELF executable, and stack memory grows dynamically.
  - **Protection**: Enforces Read/Write/Execute permissions defined in the ELF headers.
- **Storage & File System**
  - **Virtual File System (VFS)**: An abstract layer routing file operations to their respective handlers
  - **In-Memory Disk**: Simulates a block device with 4KB sectors.
  - **Stub File System**: A lightweight contiguous-allocation filesystem that tracks file metadata and disk blocks.
  - **File Handles**: Polymorphic file descriptors allowing uniform read/write calls across the Console and Disk.
  
- **System Calls**
  - `SYS_WRITE`: Handles output to stdout/stderr.
  - `SYS_READ`: Basic input handling from stdin.
  - `SYS_EXIT`: Manages process termination and exit codes.
  - `SYS_THREAD_CREATE`: Creates a thread object.
  - `SYS_THREAD_EXIT`: Exit the current thread.
  - `SYS_THREAD_JOIN`: Join one thread with another thread.
  - `SYS_MUTEX_CREATE`: Create a mutex lock for this process.
  - `SYS_MUTEX_LOCK`: Try to acquire the lock.
  - `SYS_MUTEX_UNLOCK`: Try to release the lock.
  - `SYS_OPEN`: open a file, return the file descriptor id.
  - `SYS_CLOSE`: close the file.
  - `SYS_CREATE`: create a file.
